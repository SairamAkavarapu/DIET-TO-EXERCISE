            <h2>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h2>
            <p>BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. It is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m²).</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Formula:</strong> BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))<br>
                <strong>Categories:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Underweight: BMI &lt; 18.5</li>
                    <li>Normal weight: BMI 18.5–24.9</li>
                    <li>Overweight: BMI 25–29.9</li>
                    <li>Obesity: BMI ≥ 30</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h2>
            <p>BMR is the number of calories your body needs to accomplish its most basic (basal) life-sustaining functions.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Formulas:</strong><br>
                <em>For Men:</em> BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)<br>
                <em>For Women:</em> BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)
            </p>

        <section id="body-fat">
            <h2>Body Fat Percentage</h2>
            <p>Body fat percentage is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. It is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates a person's relative body composition without regard to height or weight.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Formula:</strong><br>
                <em>For Men:</em> Body Fat % = 1.20 × BMI + 0.23 × age - 16.2<br>
                <em>For Women:</em> Body Fat % = 1.20 × BMI + 0.23 × age - 5.4
